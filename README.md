This project implements a Monty Hall problem simulation in Python. The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle based on a game show scenario. The simulation aims to demonstrate the counterintuitive probability result through code.

Key Features
Simulation Setup:

Simulates multiple iterations of the Monty Hall game to observe outcomes.
Allows the user to specify the number of trials for a comprehensive analysis.
Game Mechanics:

Initial Choice: Simulates the contestant's initial choice of one of three doors.
Host Action: Simulates the host revealing a goat behind one of the two remaining doors.
Switching Choice: Simulates the contestant's decision to switch or stay with the initial choice.
Probability Calculation:

Calculates the probability of winning if the contestant switches versus if they stay with the initial choice.
Demonstrates the higher probability of winning when the contestant switches.
Results and Analysis:

Outputs the results of the simulations, including win rates for switching and staying.
Provides a clear demonstration of the probability theory behind the Monty Hall problem.
Usage
The script can be run from the command line, allowing users to input the number of trials. The results will be displayed in the terminal, showcasing the benefits of switching doors in the game.

This project serves as an educational tool to understand probability concepts and to demonstrate the Monty Hall problem through practical simulation.
